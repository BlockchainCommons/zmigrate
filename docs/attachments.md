# How To Use Attachments with ZeWIF

The ZeWIF data format is build on [Gordian Envelope](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/). This provides it with access to many additional features that might not be utilized in the first iteration of the ZeWIF standard but which may be of use in the future, including compression, elision, and encryption.

Another special feature of Envelope is the "attachment", which is fully detailed in [BCR-2023-006](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-006-envelope-attachment.md) and summarized here. Attachments _are_ used in ZeWIF, specifically to store content for certain data classes.

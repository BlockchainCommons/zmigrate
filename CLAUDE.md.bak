# CLAUDE.md - ZCash Wallet Export/Import Format Guidelines

## Project Overview

This project consists of four related crates in the `bc-rust` workspace:
- `zmigrate`: Command line tool to migrate wallets between different ZCash wallet formats
- `zewif`: Defines the ZeWIF interchange format for ZCash wallets using a common in-memory and serialized representation
- `zewif-zcashd`: Provides ZCashd-specific structures and migration code
- `zewif-zingo`: Provides Zingo-specific structures and migration code

**IMPORTANT**: Only make changes to these four crates and no others in the workspace.

Note: The `target` directory is located outside the workspace. For dependency information, ask for assistance or refer to online crate documentation.

## Purpose and Design Philosophy

The ZeWIF format and zmigrate tool are designed for **data interchange**, not operational wallet functionality:

- **Purpose**: Enable migration between different ZCash wallet implementations
- **Focus**: Data preservation and format conversion, not wallet implementation
- **Future Plans**: Will eventually use Gordian Envelope for attachments (not implemented yet)

### Key Design Goals

1. **Wallet Migration**: Convert wallets between different implementations
2. **Data Preservation**: Ensure no critical wallet data is lost during transfers
3. **Interoperability**: Create a universal format that works with any ZCash wallet
4. **Key Recovery**: Facilitate recovery of keys and addresses from various wallet formats

### Design Approach

- Uses **optional fields** throughout to handle differences between wallet implementations
- Only populates fields when the corresponding data exists in the source wallet
- Preserves all data necessary for spending while maintaining interoperability
- Prioritizes preserving critical data (keys, addresses) while handling wallet-specific data appropriately

## Key Types and Resources

### Core Types in `zewif` Crate

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Blob<N>` | Fixed-size byte array (wrapper around `[u8; N]`) |
| `Data` | Variable-size byte array (wrapper around `Vec<u8>`) |
| `u256` | 256-bit unsigned integer, little-endian byte order |
| `u252` | 252-bit unsigned integer for Orchard note commitments |
| `u160` | 160-bit unsigned integer for transparent addresses |
| `TxId` | Transaction ID (32 bytes representing a transaction hash) |
| `ZewifTop` | Top-level container for wallet data |
| `ZewifWallet` | Complete wallet representation |
| `Account` | Account within a wallet |
| `Address` | ZCash address (transparent, shielded, or unified) |
| `Transaction` | ZCash transaction |
| `Position` | Position in a note commitment tree (for spending notes) |

### Resources

- Original `zcashd` code: `reference-code/zcash-master` directory
- Transaction assignment reference: `zewif-zcashd/docs/TransactionAssignment.md`

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style and Architecture

- **NO Gordian Envelope attachments yet** - Will be added later for wallet-specific data
- **Use accessors, not pub fields** - All struct fields should be private with accessor methods
- **Production quality** - Write code as you would for a real-world implementation
- **No placeholders** - Implement full functionality or use `todo!()` for out-of-scope paths
- **Proper error handling** - Use `Result<T>` with `anyhow::Context` for all functions that can fail
- **Fail fast** - Return early if a function cannot proceed due to an error
- **Clean code** - Fix all compiler errors and Clippy lints in your modified crates

### Testing

- Add tests to `zmigrate/tests` directory
- Store test fixtures in `zmigrate/tests/fixtures/`
- Don't mark tasks as complete until all tests pass

## Current Implementation Status

### Successfully Implemented Features

✅ **Core Wallet Structure**
- Basic wallet components fully migrated
- Account structure properly created and maintained
- 100% of transactions preserved across migration
- All addresses preserved and correctly mapped

✅ **Transaction Processing**
- 100% transaction assignment to correct accounts
- Transaction metadata (status, timestamps, block hashes) preserved
- Witness data properly extracted and preserved 
- Note commitment trees migrated with position information

✅ **Key Management**
- Spending keys successfully migrated
- Incoming viewing keys preserved
- Key-to-address relationships maintained

### Areas for Improvement

⚠️ **Memo Data Handling**
- Memo data preserved in encrypted form
- Not directly accessible without decryption keys (by design)
- Requires receiving wallet to handle decryption

⚠️ **Blockchain Data Access**
- Block hashes preserved but heights need blockchain access
- Complete validation requires blockchain interaction

⚠️ **Viewing Key Support**
- Currently limited to incoming viewing keys
- Full viewing keys need proper implementation
- Key hierarchies need better support

## Task Roadmap

### 🔴 CURRENT PRIORITY: Viewing Key Support

1. **Enhanced Transaction Conversion**
   - Status: Partially Implemented
   - Why it's critical: Complete transaction metadata is essential for proper wallet functionality
   - Subtasks:
     a. **Implement Witness Data Support**
       - ✅ Add proper witness data extraction from source wallet
       - ✅ Implement witness data conversion to ZeWIF format
       - ✅ Create validation to ensure witness data integrity

     b. **Memo Field Preservation**
       - ✅ Preserve encrypted memo data in output ciphertexts (NOT decrypting)
       - ✅ Fix incorrect memo data storage in migration (previously storing entire ciphertext as memo)
       - ✅ Document that memo extraction/decryption is the responsibility of receiving wallet

     c. **Extract Transaction Metadata**
       - ✅ Extract and preserve block hash information (block height needs chain access)
       - ✅ Preserve transaction timestamp data when available
       - ✅ Add proper transaction status information

2. **Viewing Key Migration**
   - Status: Partially Implemented
   - Why it's critical: Viewing keys are essential for transaction history without spending capability
   - Subtasks:
     a. **Complete Viewing Key Support**
       - ⬜ Properly handle both incoming viewing keys and full viewing keys
       - ⬜ Preserve viewing key relationships with addresses
       - ⬜ Implement comprehensive viewing key validation

     b. **Add Viewing Key Derivation Logic**
       - ⬜ Implement logic for deriving viewing keys from spending keys
       - ⬜ Ensure proper key hierarchies are maintained

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

1. **Unified Address Support**
   - Status: Basic Support Implemented
   - Subtasks:
     - ⬜ Add support for unified addresses with multiple receiver types
     - ⬜ Properly handle diversifier indices
     - ⬜ Ensure proper handling of receiver types including Orchard receivers
     - ⬜ Add comprehensive tests for unified address migration

   - Subtasks:
     - ⬜ Implement robust transparent address derivation from keys and scripts
     - ⬜ Create a key registry for faster lookups
     - ⬜ Enhance HD path analysis for more accurate account determination

### COMPLETED TASKS
